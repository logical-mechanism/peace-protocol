# Happy Path Commands

The script references must be created upon first use of the happy path with `00_createScriptReferences.sh`. This will use the Holder wallet to recursively store the contracts on-chain. These transactions must be on-chain before the reference token is minted. The reference token must be minted during the first happy-path run with `01_createGenesisTx.sh`. This will mint the reference token into the reference contract. Script reference creation and reference token minting actions only happen once. Since this is a proof-of-concept, the reference contract is not intended as permanent storage for the token. It's just a simple, always true contract. If the reference datum needs updating, use `02a_updateReferenceTx.sh`. If the reference datum needs to be removed, use `02b_removeReferenceTx.sh`. Removing the reference token from the reference contract will break the happy path, and the happy path setup flow will need to be restarted.

Alice creates or removes the encryption UTxO with `03_createEncryptionTx.sh` or `04_removeEncryptionTx.sh`. Bob creates or removes the bid UTxO with `05_createBidTx.sh` or `06_removeBidTx.sh`. When an encryption and a bid UTxO exist on-chain, Alice can then perform the re-encryption step using `07_createReEncryptionTx.sh`. Bob may then decrypt with `08_decryptMessage.sh`.
