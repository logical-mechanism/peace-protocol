# Contract configuration is managed in Tauri's config.json (single source of truth).
# When Tauri starts the Express backend, it passes contract addresses, policy IDs,
# and reference script UTxOs as environment variables automatically.
# For standalone development with USE_STUBS=true, no contract config is needed.
