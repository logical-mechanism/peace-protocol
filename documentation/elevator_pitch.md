PEACE is a re-encryption protocol that enables the transfer of decryption rights. The data remains encrypted at all times, but the right to decrypt may be traded by the current owner through a multi-hop, unidirectional proxy re-encryption scheme. Allowing the new owner to decrypt the data without relying on a centralized service.

PEACE is data-layer-agnostic. Projects utilizing PEACE monetize their UI/UX, not the base protocol. PEACE is the rails for projects that enable re-encryption for their users.
