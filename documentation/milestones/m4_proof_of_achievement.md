A. Output: Final close-out report summarizing all technical and functional progress across the project, publicly available on GitHub.

Acceptance criteria: A comprehensive close-out report exists covering the full development arc (research, MVP implementation, testing, and validation); includes milestone-by-milestone outcomes, key achievements, challenges, and an evidence index with links to all supporting artifacts; publicly available on GitHub.

Evidence:
- Public repo: https://github.com/logical-mechanism/peace-protocol
- Close-out report (Markdown): https://github.com/logical-mechanism/peace-protocol/blob/main/documentation/close_out_report.md
- Report sections: Executive Summary (Section 1), Development Timeline (Section 2), Milestone-by-Milestone Outcomes and Evidence (Section 3), Key Achievements (Section 4), Challenges (Section 5), Cost and Performance Observations (Section 6), Tooling and Environment Notes (Section 7), Reviewer Reproduction Flow (Section 8), Evidence Index (Section 9), Close-Out Statement (Section 10)


B. Output: Final close-out video demonstrating live interactions with the encryption protocol and smart contracts, published and accessible through GitHub.

Acceptance criteria: A close-out video is published and linked from the GitHub repository; the video demonstrates the protocol in action and covers the scope of work completed across all milestones.

Evidence:
- Close-out video: https://www.youtube.com
- Video link in report: https://github.com/logical-mechanism/peace-protocol/blob/main/documentation/close_out_report.md


C. Output: Deliverables accurately reflect results, challenges, and validations from previous milestones.

Acceptance criteria: The close-out report and video reference and align with the outputs from Milestones 1–3, including research findings, MVP implementation, testing outcomes, and preprod validation evidence.

Evidence (report sections referencing prior milestones):
- Milestone 1 outcomes (Section 3): Technical research report, security model, threat analysis, methodology
- Milestone 2 outcomes (Section 3): MVP implementation, on-chain contracts, off-chain tooling, happy path execution
- Milestone 3 outcomes (Section 3): Comprehensive testing, preprod transaction evidence, reproducibility documentation
- Challenges encountered (Section 5): On-chain constraints, pairing mathematics, CCA-style attack surfaces, re-encryption boundaries
- Evidence index (Section 9): Direct links to all milestone artifacts and PRs


D. Output: Materials provide sufficient clarity for community members, auditors, and developers to understand the full scope of work completed.

Acceptance criteria: The report and video are written/produced at a level accessible to community reviewers, auditors, and developers; includes a reviewer reproduction flow and a consolidated evidence index for navigating all project deliverables.

Evidence:
- Reviewer reproduction flow (Section 8): https://github.com/logical-mechanism/peace-protocol/blob/main/documentation/close_out_report.md
- Evidence index (Section 9): https://github.com/logical-mechanism/peace-protocol/blob/main/documentation/close_out_report.md
- All milestone PRs linked for traceability:
  - Milestone 1 PR: https://github.com/logical-mechanism/peace-protocol/pull/2
  - Milestone 2 PR: https://github.com/logical-mechanism/peace-protocol/pull/7
  - Milestone 3 PR: https://github.com/logical-mechanism/peace-protocol/pull/8


E. Output: Timestamped publication evidence (immutable).

Acceptance criteria: Evidence is tied to a specific public commit/tag/release so reviewers can verify the exact state at submission time.

Evidence:
- Milestone 4 PR: https://github.com/logical-mechanism/peace-protocol/pull/TBD
