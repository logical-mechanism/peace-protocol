# Abstract

In this report, we introduce the PEACE protocol, an ECIES-based, multi-hop, bidirectional proxy re-encryption scheme for Cardano. PEACE solves the encrypted-NFT problem by providing a decentralized, open-source protocol for transferable encryption rights, enabling creators, collectors, and developers to manage encrypted NFTs without relying on centralized decryption services. This work fills a significant gap in secure, private access to NFTs on Cardano. The PEACE protocol was funded in round 14 of Project Catalyst[^fund].

# Introduction

The encrypted NFT problem is one of the most significant issues with current NFT standards on Cardano. Either the data is not encrypted, available to everyone who views the nft, or the data encryption requires some form of centralization, some company doing the encryption on behalf of users. Current solutions [@stuffio-whitepaper] claim to offer decentralized encrypted assets (DEA), but lack a publicly available, verifiable cryptographic protocol or an open-source implementation. Most, if not all, of the mechanics behind current DEA solutions remain undisclosed. This report aims to fill that knowledge gap by providing an open-source implementation of a decentralized encryption protocol for encrypted assets on Cardano.

The encryption protocol must allow tradability of both the NFT itself and the right to decrypt the NFT data, implying that the solution must involve smart contracts and a form of encryption that allows data to be re-encrypted for another user without revealing the encrypted content in the process. The bright contract side of the protocol should be reasonably straightforward. It needs a way to price a token to hold the encrypted data and allow other users to receive it. To ensure tradability, the tokens may need to be soulbound. On the other side of the protocol is the encryption required to make this all work. Luckily, this type of encryption has been in cryptography research for quite some time [@mambo-okamoto-1997] [@blaze-bleumer-strauss-1998] [@ateniese-et-al-ndss2005]. There are even patented cloud-based solutions already in existence [@ironcore-recrypt-rs]. There is no open-source, fully on-chain, decentralized encryption protocol for encrypting NFT data on Cardano. The PEACE protocol aims to solve this problem.
